# Data Science For Business!


**By [Armando Pe√±a](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jarmandopl/)**

I made this site to share my learning path and knowledge of data analytics. 

I also want to give free and easy access to this information for people interested in learning data analytics. 

I'll focus in the theoretical framework, instead of the coding part. Even though, the notebooks contain hidden code snippets, so you can learn with real code examples. 

I hope you find this website interesting and useful.
