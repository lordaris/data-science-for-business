# Welcome!

Hello! My name is Armando Pe√±a. I'm an environmental technology engineering student, living in Mexico. 

I have knowledge in Python programming, and I decided to use it for data analysis and data science.

I made this site as a portfolio and also to share my learning path and knowledge of data analytics and data science.

The technologies used in this site are: 
- GitHub Pages
- Jupyter Book and Jupyter Notebooks
- Markdown files
- LaTeX 
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Scipy
- Seaborn
- Numpy
- wquantiles
- statsmodels

I want to give free and easy access to this information for people interested in learning data analytics. 

I'll focus in the theoretical framework, instead of the coding part. Even so, the notebooks contain hidden code snippets, so you can learn with real code examples. 

I hope you find this website interesting and useful.
